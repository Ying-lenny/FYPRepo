PortFoliGo is a web app aiming to serve as a platform for artists in need of a way to archive their artwork portfolio online without the cost of creating and maintaining a site of their own while still offering a professional level of presentation. I feel that many artists online are not getting a chance to show off their talents and because of this, I felt that an app such as mine could serve this position.
